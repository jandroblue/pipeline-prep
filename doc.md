# About This Project

Pipeline-prep project's goal is in two folds - first creates a set reusable modules used in running the first two steps of a given data pipeline then create and automation to run the pre-indexing step. 

The goals :
  1) Pre-Indexing reference genome/transcripome
  2) Automate Pre-indexing step
  3) Pre-processing the reads.
  
The root directory of the project contains two main diretories - data_sources and tools

## Pre-Indexing reference genome/transcripome
Indexes are created by tool version -> data source version > organism-dataset. Each data source specifies
data format for a given dataset and each tool has its own sets of command to index the reference data.

Each tool is a directory under tools  and each directory contains the following files:
1)	A readme.md file
2)	A config file tool.cfg
3)	Refeence.csv file mapping tool to datasets
4)	The Index shell script to setup and index datasets

Each data source is config file (tool.cfg) under data_sources/  and each config file contains the
Mapping between datasets and the file format
