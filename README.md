# Data Processing Pipelines

```
 "Pipelines are composed of discrete steps that can represent an algorithm, 
 a software tool, or a file format manipulation. These steps are applied to the primary data
 (generated from an experimental assay) to produce visualizable data" ~ENCODE
 ```
 ## Pipeline Tools
 ### Alingment tools - Short reads:
 * Bwa
 * Bowtie 
 * Hisat2 
 * star
 
 ### Alingment tools - Long reads:
 *	Bowtie2
 *	Bwa(BWA-SW and BWA-MEM)
 *	Hisat2 (a replacement of Tophat)

 ### File Processing:
 * Bamtools
 * Bedtools
 * Samtools
 
 ### Statistical Computing
 * R
 * Cufflinks : 
 ```
 Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and tests for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It accepts aligned RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.

 ## Vesioning Pipelines
 
 ## RNA-Seq Pipelines
 * RNAs Long Reads - longer than 200 bp: for mRNAs (poly-A(+)), rRNA-depleted total RNA, or poly-A(-) RNA populations
     * Paired-end
     * Single-ended

 * RNAs Short reads - shorter than 200 bp: for mRNAs (poly-A(+)), rRNA-depleted total RNA, or poly-A(-) RNA populations
 * miRNA-seq: for microRNAs, around 22nt long, that are quantified from RNA-seq data
 * miRNA counts: a complement to miRNA-seq 

## RAMPAGE Pipelines

RAMPAGE (RNA Annotation and Mapping of Promoters for the Analysis of Gene Expression) is a very accurate sequencing approach to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) at base-pair resolution, to quantify their expression, and to characterize their transcripts. RAMPAGE uses direct cDNA evidence to link specific genes and their TSSs.
