# Data Processing Pipelines

```
 "Pipelines are composed of discrete steps that can represent an algorithm, 
 a software tool, or a file format manipulation. These steps are applied to the primary data
 (generated from an experimental assay) to produce visualizable data" ~ENCODE
 ```
 ## Input
 Data from major experimental assay types generated by the project: 
 * RNA-seq, 
 * RAMPAGE1,
